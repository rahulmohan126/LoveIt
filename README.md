# LoveIt Theme Fork

This repository was forked because the orginal seems to be unmaintained since the creator has not accepted pull requests or commited new changes to the repo since May 29 (as of September 2020). This repo is for me to fix any bugs or add any features that I see fit until such a time when the orignal repo becomes usable.

## Changes made

- Added google analytics to "baseof.html"
- Fixed config parsing for the "comment" section in "init.html"
- Added custom commento server support in "comment.html" (add a string for the url tag in params.page.comment.commento, i.e. `url = "https://commento.mysite.com/js/commento.js"`)
- Stackoverflow icon fixed in "social.yml"
